# JSFConverter
This uses the JspParser and will convert JSF 1.2 JSP files to JSF 2 Facelets XHTML files.  It has a basic implementation of providing one file at a time, but could easily be expanded to loop through a directory if those are your needs.

There is also prepatory work for converting RichFaces 3.3 to RichFaces 4 in the same conversion handler above.
